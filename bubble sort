Start
Declare variables newArray, i, j ,temp,n
declare boolean variable swap
Input the values of the array
Use loop for the following steps
  -> for i is equal to 0 to i less than the value n increament i
       -> set swap to false
       -> use loop for the following steps 
       -> for j is equal to zero to i is less than n minus 1 increament j
          -> use conditional statement for the following
          -> if newArray[j] is greater than next value 
            -> swap the two values
            -> set swap to true
          -> end condition statment
          -> If swap equals to false 
          -> break
       -> End loop
   -> End loop
Print newArray
